JMS is the technique used in J2EE technology  for an application to communicate with other applications.
An application can communicate with any number of applications using JMS.This communication is loosely coupled.
Because the applications needed to communicate are not connecting each other directly . Instead , those applications 
are connecting to a common destination. 

Java Message Service(JMS) API is an important API in J2EE . This API plays an important role in supporting 
other APIs in J2EE.

An application can send messages to the destination and can take messages from the same destination

JMS API supports Point-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe approaches.
